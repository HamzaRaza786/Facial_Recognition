# Facial recognition system in python using Tensorflow and Keras. 

We created a Facial recognition system in python using Tensorflow and Keras. We used pre-trained weights and the model by Victor Sy Wang's implementation and was loaded using his code: https://github.com/iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace and also from the course of Convolutional Models from Deeplearning.ai. We also developed GUI using Tkinter and used gtts library to voice out the recognized face by our convolutional neural network model through triplet loss cost function. MTCNN library was used to extract faces from the images so that we can have better training data.
